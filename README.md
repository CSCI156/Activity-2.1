###  Exercise 2.1. 
#### 1. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
        width = 16
        height = 12.0
        delimiter = '.'

For each of the following expressions, figure out the value of the expression and the type of the value (int, float, or string).

        i. width/2

        ii. width/2.0

        iii. height/3

        iv. 1 + 2 * 5

        v. delimiter * 5

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

#### 2. You can force an answer to be an integer using the int(command). What is the output from the following code?

```
print(8/2)
print(int(8/2)
print(int(9/2))
print(int(9.9/2)
``` 

What does int() do to decimals?

#### 3. Use Python to print 23 a’s without typing 23 a’s.

#### 4. Store your name in a variable. Put the string “My name is” in another variable. Use these two variables to print the string 
                            My name is <your name>


####Bonus: Print
        Hello
        World!
with a single print command.
